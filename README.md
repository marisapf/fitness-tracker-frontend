This is still not finished. 
It seems like there is an endless amount of editing.
It is not cleaned up and it is not ready to be turned in. 
I would like to improve messages depending on what user does. 

When user clicks to manage activities/my activities, this page needs more work. 

The CSS is bad and it is arduous to go through and try to fix and adjust things and it doesn't change in browser. 
Still needs a lot of editing.
I have files I didn't use and comments and console.logs I haven't taken out. 
I need more time to keep working on it. 

It became too big,  awkward and too difficult to keep track of activities, routines, edit pages, element tags.
I was trying to get the Edit Activity to work. 
I tried to do what Nick showed me to do in My Routines to display the current information that the user wants to edit.

Much of this was working. Sometimes when I change something, something else stops working. 

When I click around, sometimes I get the error in console 'process not defined' and the 
screen locks up. I thought process.env was in the back end.

My component file is too big and unwieldy. I have components that I did not need (like single views/get single views). 
I might still try to use them, so I have not deleted them. 

I spent too much time not being able to get code to work.  
When I think I was following the logic of how it should be working, 
There are similarities in the processes like creating something, deleting, updating.. I thought the same process would work on a different step, but 
it always took too long to get it to work. 

I did not know I would need so many API calls.  I modeled this after Stranger Things and Art Collector.
However, I should have been able to get the one API function to work, but didn't have time to refactor the APP.

WhenI refactor something, it will make something else not work. I still need to try this on a few components first.
